# Grab That Kitten!

This game was my first project at Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp. 

You can play the MVP here: https://pavaoana.github.io/GrabThatKittenGame/


# Technologies

For this MVP I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript (DOM manipulation).


# Plot line & Instructions

Quick! A bunch of kittens is on the loose!
They need to be rescued NOW.

Your goal is to grab as many kittens as you can.
Move your mouse on the screen and click on the kittens as they appear.
If you fail to rescue enough kittens, you'll lose.
If you manage to catch a Momma Cat, you'll receive extra points.


# MVP

This MVP includes a landing page with the plot line for the game and instructions. 
This page will redirect you to the game once you press Start Game.

The game is played using the mouse (or touchpad) to click on the elements that appear on the screen.
We collect cats by clicking on them. 
One cat type will give you extra points when clicked.
The points are displayed on the screen as you play.

A "you won" and "you lost" page are displayed whether you win or lose the game.
They will redirect you to the game page if you would like to play again.

The game is responsive enough to be played on your mobile phone (even though this still needs improvements).
