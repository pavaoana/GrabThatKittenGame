      <h1>Grab That Kitten!</h1>

      <p>Quick! A bunch of kittens is on the loose! <br> They need to be rescued NOW.</p>

      <div>
        <button onclick="expandFunction()">Learn How To Play</button>        
        <div id="instructions">
          Your goal is to grab as many kittens as you can.<br>
          Move your mouse on the screen and click on the kittens as they appear.<br>
          If you fail to rescue enough kittens, you'll lose (and go straight to hell).<br>
          That's it! Now let's play. (Scroll down if you need to.)
